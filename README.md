# KawanApp

Kawan App is a mobile application built for IMCC USM. This app was never published due to difficulty in maintaining it by the stakeholders that do not have Xamarin developers.
This app is ready to use and some future work has been outlined for it.

# Abstract
A Kawan member is a student ambassador whose function is to help international 
students in Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). Important questions related to and 
integrity problems in student ambassadors can be resolved through the integration of a 
data analytics component. This project is an extension of an existing Kawan web portal 
project with a focus on introducing new features comparable to social networking 
applications, volunteering applications, and on-demand service applications. The 
domain of the project is primarily focused around the Kawan initiative and involves, 
sign up, student-Kawan member matching, providing Kawan member services, logging 
activities, and providing feedback. The project consists of 3 major modules i.e. user 
authentication, profiles, and Kawan member services and includes a data analytics sub-module. 
The project was conducted in 2 iterations and included an experiment purposed 
to find the best supervised machine learning technique for the rank prediction task. The 
system developed within this project operates in a client-server architecture with two 
transmission modes. The system made use of the MVVM architecture pattern and it 
was concluded that Random Forest Classification would be the best supervised learning 
technique in terms of speed and accuracy for rank prediction. In total, 4 testing 
strategies were employed to ensure a smooth and proper operation of the system. 
Although the system achieved the desired expectations of the users, it could be 
improved by upgrading the Xamarin.Forms version to overcome a fatal bug and the 
system could be bettered in terms of compatibility. The goals and objectives of the 
project were met, but suggestions for future work are mainly centered in bettering the 
convenience of the system, employing more intelligent mechanics, improving the data 
analytics, and researching into transfer learning methods. The outcome of this project 
is a mobile application client that consumes a database and four servers. The mobile 
application makes available a data analytics dashboard with predictive analytics.
